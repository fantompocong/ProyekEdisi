# Proyek Edisi - "Mencari Kabar"
a collaborative project by PROYEK EDISI in 2022
-
PROYEK EDISI is a young artists' initiative based in Yogyakarta. This group focuses on the study and practice of performance art. Documentations of the process and outputs of the study are distributed through social media.

PROYEK EDISI's members who were mostly born in the 1990s, have hazy and vague memories of the New Order and the events that accompanied and marked the downfall of the regime. The “Monetary Crisis” is the only thing that they had experienced, which may even just be encountered without any comprehension.

Recognizing their limited knowledge on Reformasi 98 and its Monetary Crisis phenomenon, PROYEK EDISI attempts to complement their understanding by looking at the archive of mass media as their primary source, one of which was the Kedaulatan Rakyat newspaper which also operated during 1998 and coverage the issue regarding the monetary crisis in Yogyakarta.

The collected news archives are then responded to by reading out loud or reciting selected articles on the sites mentioned in the news. PROYEK EDISI's members interpret the discourse of the media by experimenting with form, choreography, utterance, and camera's angle capturing of events at the location during the declamation.

Video performance artworks of the reciting will be uploaded to the YouTube channel of PROYEK EDISI and distributed through other social media. Also, in collaboration with @fantompocong , one of the exponents of the Non-Blok Movement (an Indonesian crypto artist movement active on the Fantom Opera network), PROYEK EDISI will mint and distribute selected news articles from the Kedaulatan Rakyat's archive into the blockchain network (100% on-chain).

This project is part of Jalar Rimpang, for the event "KUMPAR RIMPANG: Almanak Rimpang Nusantara 2022”, part of the Rhizomatic Archipelago Programme, Cemeti - Institute for Art and Society.
